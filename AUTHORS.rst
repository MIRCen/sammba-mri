There is no publication yet about sammba-MRI. If you use it, please cite
the tool name ``SaMmBa-MRI`` and the website address.


Citing nilearn and nipype
-------------------------

Sammba-MRI heavily depends on nilearn and nipype. Please read

`how to cite nilearn

RATS reference papers
---------------------
sammba-MRI relies on RATS software for brain extraction. If you preprocess your
data with sammba-MRI, you are obliged to reference these two papers.
